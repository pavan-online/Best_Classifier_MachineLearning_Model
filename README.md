# Best_Classifier_MachineLearning_Model
Study Titanic dataset and create best classifier model to predict the survival 
Check the Titanic DataSet 
We first do exploratory data analysis to remove the unwanted columns, combine few columns and fill null values in to age, create cabin related column
We then use sklearn library to split data and train on various machine learning models
Create test train model to split the data in to 60% for training, 20% for validating various models and 20 % for testing the data
We then run the training set among various models namely: LogisticRegression, SVM, MLP, RF, GradientBoosting
Hypertune all models with the help of GridSearchCV
Finally we compare Accuracy, Precision and Recall values of all the models and finalize which is the best model to predit the values of survival
